# SQL_CASE_STUDY: SIDOCOMMS MOVIES MANAGEMENT 
 As I embark on an exciting case study, I find myself at the threshold of a potential business deal with an enthusiastic acquirer interested in purchasing my cherished Movies Rental Business. This potential buyer is a seasoned owner of restaurants and bars, which means their inquiries are both intriguing and numerous. The generous offer on the table makes it all the more enticing, urging me to delve into the intricacies of my business and the rental industry as a whole.
To address the acquirer's curiosity, I rely on my SQL skills, which prove to be invaluable assets in extracting and analysing data from various tables in the extensive Movies Database. Each question posed by the acquirer necessitates the crafting of multi-table SQL queries, skilfully joining at least two tables to reveal insightful answers

### Question 1: 
My partner and I want to come by each store and meet each person and the managers, please send over the managers names at each store, with the full address of each property(street address, district, city and country)

### Question 2: 
I would like to get a better understanding of all the inventory that would come along with the business. Please pull together a list of each inventory item you have stocked, including the store id number, the inventory id, the name of the film, the films rating, its rental rate and replacement cost

### Question 3: 
From the same list of films you just pulled, please roll that data up and provide a summary level overview of your inventory. We would like to know how many inventory items you have with each rating at each store


### Question 4: 
Similarly, we want to understand how diversified the inventory is in terms of replacement cost. We want to see how big of a hit it would be if a certain category of film became unpopular at certain store. We would like to see the number of films, as well as average replacement cost, and total replacement cost sliced by store and film category


### Question 5: 
we want to make sure you folks have a good handle on who your customers are. Please provide a list of all customer names, which store they go to, whether or not they are currently active, and their full addresses: street address, city and country


### Question 6: 
we would like to understand how much your customers are spending with you, and also to know who your most valuable customers are. Please pull together a list of customer names, their total lifetime rentals, and the sum of all payments you have collected from them. It would be great to see this ordered on total lifetime value, with the most valuable customers at the top of the list


### Question 7: 
my partner and I would like to get to know your board of advisors and any current investors. Could you please provide a list of advisor and investor names in one table? Could you please note whether they are an investor or advisor and for the investors, it would be good to include which company they work with.
